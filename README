OVERVIEW: Assignment #5
________________

This assignment is broken into 5 parts detailed below.

1.) Implements an interpreter for the proposition calculus using scheme
following the syntax below:

    < boolexp > → #t | #f [boolean constants]
    < boolexp > → variable [boolean variables]
    < boolexp > → (and boolexp ... boolexp)
    < boolexp > → (or boolexp ... boolexp)
    < boolexp > → (not boolexp)
    < boolexp > → (implies boolexp boolexp)
                  [P => Q, where P is the first argument and Q is the second argument]
    < boolexp > → (equiv boolexp boolexp)
                  [P <=> Q, where P is the first argument and Q is the second argument]

Your interpreter should take a boolean expression and an environment and return
#t or #f. If an undefined variable is encountered then return the symbol
error. Your interpreter should first transform boolean operators (and and or)
with more than two arguments to nested operators with just two arguments
(similar to the way cond is handled in the scheme interpreter).

2.) Use your boolean expression interpreter from question 1 to prove
tautologies. I.E. a boolean expression that is true for all possible values of
the variables. E.G. (or P (not P)), (equiv (or P Q) (or Q P)), (equiv (or P Q)
(or P (and (not P) Q))). Your prover should generate all possible values for
the variables occuring in the boolean expression [all possible bindings], and
using your interpreter, check to verify that the expression is true for all
possible variable bindings.

3.) Trace scheme interpreter from SICP using as input the following two
expressions [you will have to add =, *, - as primitive procedures for this to
work].

          (define (fact n)
             (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (fact (- n 1)))))
          (fact 3)

    You should indicate exactly how the interpreter interprets this code.

4.) Modify the SICP interpreter to use dynamic instead of static scope. Provide
an example where the same code provides two different answers depending on
which scoping rule is used.

5.) Implement an interpreter for the mini language in scheme. Use the following
representation for mini language programs.

    prog -> stmt-list
    stmt-list -> (stmt-seq)
    stmt-seq -> stmt | stmt stmt-seq
    stmt -> assign-stmt | if-stmt | while-stmt
    assign-stmt -> (assign identifier expr)
    if-stmt -> (if expr stmt-list stmt-list)
    while-stmt -> (while expr stmt-list)
    expr -> integer | identifier | (+ expr expr) | (- expr expr) | (* expr expr)
