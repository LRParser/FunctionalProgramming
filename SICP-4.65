Exercise 4.65.  Cy D. Fect, looking forward to the day when he will rise in the organization, gives a query to find all the wheels (using the wheel rule of section 4.4.1):

(wheel ?who)

To his surprise, the system responds

;;; Query results:
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Bitdiddle Ben))
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))

Why is Oliver Warbucks listed four times? 

-------------------------
Based on the rule below:
-------------------------
(rule (wheel ?person)                   
      (and (supervisor ?
middle-manager ?person)                   
           (supervisor ?x ?middle-manager)))

-------------------------
The following are true:
-------------------------		   
(rule (wheel (Warbucks Oliver))                   
      (and (supervisor (Bitdiddle Ben) (Warbucks Oliver))    (supervisor (Hacker Alyssa P) (Bitdiddle Ben))))

(rule (wheel (Warbucks Oliver))                   
      (and (supervisor (Bitdiddle Ben) (Warbucks Oliver))    (supervisor (Fect Cy D) (Bitdiddle Ben))))

(rule (wheel (Warbucks Oliver))                   
      (and (supervisor (Bitdiddle Ben) (Warbucks Oliver))    (supervisor (Tweakit Lem E) (Bitdiddle Ben))))

(rule (wheel (Warbucks Oliver))                   
      (and (supervisor (Scrooge Eben) (Warbucks Oliver))    (supervisor (Cratchet Robert) (Scrooge Eben))))
