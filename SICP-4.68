Exercise 4.68.  Define rules to implement the reverse operation of exercise 2.18, which returns a list containing the same elements as a given list in reverse order. (Hint: Use append-to-form.) Can your rules answer both (reverse (1 2 3) ?x) and (reverse ?x (1 2 3)) ? 

(assert!(rule (reverse () ())))
(assert!(rule(reverse ?x ?y)
            (and (append-to-form (?car) ?cdr ?x)
            (append-to-form ?cdr-rev (?car) ?y)
            (reverse ?cdr ?cdr-rev))       
        ))

TODO: Check if rules can answer both below:

Can your rules answer both (reverse (1 2 3) ?x) and (reverse ?x (1 2 3)) ? 

TODO: Do the same in Prolog.
